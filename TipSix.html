      <h1 class="w3-center">Change, loss and bereavement</h1><br>

      <h5 class="w3-center">Times of change and loss</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">Change and loss can involve many things. During the coronavirus pandemic, all of us have been affected one way or another by changes. This may have been adjusting to the loss of not being able to go where we choose or coping with the loss in our income or job. The latter can in turn affect our identity. </p>

      <h5 class="w3-center">How our minds and bodies react to bereavement</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">Whatever the loss, our mind and body will react to this change. Something or someone that was there before is no longer there. Something or someone we depended on as part of our lives has gone. There has been a change. This can shake our world, and how it does so, will depend on what has happened and what support we have in place to cope. 

        When we are bereaved, we can feel anxious, sad, angry, shocked, grief-stricken, withdrawn, in disbelief, guilty, sad and in denial – and experience these in no particular order. We can struggle with sleep, concentration, our appetite and making decisions. We can also experience physical pain, such as headaches and muscle pain, as well as less specific bodily reactions that are similar to feelings of anxiety.</p>

      <h5 class="w3-center">It is normal to have mixed feelings following change, loss, and bereavement</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">It is entirely normal to feel such intense feelings. It is a time of trying to make sense of the change our losses bring, whatever they are. It is about adjusting to our ‘new normal’. However, we also need to remember that when people are bereaved, their feelings are very challenging to bear, and sometimes they can feel intolerable. This can be a very difficult time. </p>

      <h5 class="w3-center">A few things that might help with change, loss and bereavement </h5>
      <p class="w3-large">Here are a few self-help suggestions that might help you with any difficult feelings you may be experiencing while adjusting to change, loss and bereavement: </p>

      <h5 class="w3-center">Feel the feelings</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">Allow yourself space to be with the feelings you are experiencing. Sometimes you may find it useful to talk with someone about your feelings, such as a phone call or video call with a friend, or sometimes you may just want to be alone with your feelings. There may also be times when writing down your feelings and thoughts or using music or art as an outlet is helpful too. Remind yourself that with any loss and change, difficult feelings will follow. </p>
      
      <h5 class="w3-center">There is no time limit to grief</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">For many people, the intensity of loss will diminish over time, but for others, it may not. It is important to work out how we remember the person who has died, and how we continue relating to their memory and what they meant to us, even though they are not with us any more in body. </p>
