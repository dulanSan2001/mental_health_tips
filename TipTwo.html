      <h3 class="w3-center">Focus on the things you enjoy</h3>
      <p class="w3-large">This could be an existing hobby or something brand new that you wanted to have a go at. Try creating things (e.g. drawing, painting, writing, crafting), playing games or puzzles, decorating, or spending time watching or creating content on social media or streaming sites.</p>
    
      <h3 class="w3-center">Set limits on the news and social media</h3>
      <p class="w3-large">While it is good to stay informed, media coverage of world and UK events can also be overwhelming and make us anxious and worried. Experiment to find the balance of news and media coverage that works for you. YoungMinds has information on how to have a more positive experience online.

        try setting limits on how much media you watch, only going to a limited number of reliable places for news, sorting out your social media feeds to prioritise content that makes you feel good, and limiting content that makes you feel anxious or down, for example by muting particular people or hashtags
        check out screen time features available on your smartphone or the Some Good News YouTube channel</p>
    
        <h3 class="w3-center">Connect with others</h3>
        <p class="w3-large">Find time regularly to connect with friends, family, classmates, co-workers or others. It can help you all feel more connected.   

            Try different ways of keeping in touch to find the ones that work best (e.g. video calls, quizzes or games with friends). If you use video calls for work or study, you might want to try something else for socialising: an online watch party where you all stream the same film and chat together, for example, or simply a phone call.</p>
    
        <h3 class="w3-center">Find your routine</h3>
        <p class="w3-large">Try to find a routine that is realistic, flexible, and includes some fun. There are many ways to do this, so experiment with what works best for you.  The proper routine for you might look different from someone else’s, and that’s okay!

            Try picking three things to do daily, breaking your day into chunks, or planning regular mealtimes and bedtimes.</p>
